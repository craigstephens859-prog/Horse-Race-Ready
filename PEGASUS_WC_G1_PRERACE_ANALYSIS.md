## EXPECTED DYNAMICS AT 9F ROUTES vs 12F MARATHONS

### What Should Be DIFFERENT from McKnight G3 Marathon:

1. **Jockey Skill Matters MORE**
   - Elite jockeys (Irad Ortiz Jr 29%, Flavien Prat 20%) should have advantage
   - Tactical positioning crucial in 2-turn race
   - At marathons: workout percentile > jockey skill
   - At routes: jockey skill + workout percentiles both matter

2. **Recent Form More Important**
   - 30-60 day layoffs may be NEGATIVE (not freshening bonus like 12f+)
   - Horses with sharp recent races preferred
   - Longer layoffs (90+ days) more concerning at routes

3. **Class Ratings Highly Important**
   - G1 level competition = proven G1 winners have edge
   - Horses stepping up in class face difficulty
   - At marathons: stamina indicators weighted higher

4. **Speed Figures Matter More**
   - Higher pace, more tactical speed needed
   - Last race speed ratings more predictive
   - At marathons: stamina/workout percentiles weighted higher

## CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR VALIDATION

After race results, we need to evaluate:

1. **Did jockey skill matter MORE at 9f than at 12f marathons?**
   - Irad Ortiz Jr (29%) and Flavien Prat (20%) vs. weaker jockeys
   - At McKnight: Elite jockey (Irad 29%) LOST to 17% jockey

2. **Did workout percentiles still predict winners at routes?**
   - Disco Time (Top 13%), Skippylongstocking (Top 13%), Mika (Top 11%)
   - At McKnight: Top 50% work predicted winner better than top elite work

3. **Was the outside post bias (2.23 impact) real?**
   - White Abarrio (#11), Mika (#10), Brotha Keny (#12)
   - Similar to Padiddle finishing 2nd from outside at McKnight

4. **Did long layoffs hurt more at routes than marathons?**
   - White Abarrio (146 days), Captain Cook (98 days)
   - At McKnight: 30-60 day layoffs HELPED (freshening)

5. **Did E/P running style (1.08 impact) hold true?**
   - Disco Time, White Abarrio, Skippylongstocking all E/P types
   - Track bias says E/P and P types favored (1.08-1.30 impact)

## COMPARISON TO MCKNIGHT G3 MARATHON

| Factor | McKnight G3 (12f) | Pegasus WC (9f) | Expected Difference |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Distance** | 1.5 miles (12f) | 1 1/8 miles (9f) | Routes shorter, faster pace |
| **Surface** | Turf | Dirt | Different surface dynamics |
| **Class** | G3 | G1 | Much higher class level |
| **Jockey Impact** | LOW (17% beat 29%) | HIGH (elite jockeys favored) | Should matter MORE at 9f |
| **Workout %ile** | HIGH (Top 50% won) | HIGH (should still predict) | Same importance expected |
| **Layoff Bonus** | POSITIVE (30-60 days) | NEGATIVE (90+ days hurt) | Opposite effect! |
| **Fresh Legs** | POSITIVE (≤10 starts) | NEUTRAL (more starts ok) | Less important at routes |
| **Post Position** | Not analyzed | CRITICAL (2.23 outside!) | Major factor at Gulfstream |

---

## SYSTEM ACCURACY TEST

**Pre-Race Predictions (to validate post-race):**

| Metric | Prediction | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Win Accuracy** | #1 Disco Time | 40%+ = success |
| **Top 3 Accuracy** | #1, #11, #5 in top 3 | 2 of 3 = success |
| **Exacta Hit** | #1-#11 or #1-#5 | Either = success |
| **ROI Positive** | Betting strategy | Break-even+ = success |

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ If Disco Time wins: System validated at routes
- ✅ If White Abarrio wins despite layoff: Home track > workout concerns
- ✅ If outside post (#10, #11, #12) wins: Post bias confirmed
- ✅ If longshot with bullet work wins: McKnight pattern repeating

---

## FINAL PREDICTION

**WINNER: #1 DISCO TIME**  
**RUNNER-UP: #11 WHITE ABARRIO**  
**THIRD: #5 SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING**  
**FOURTH: #10 MIKA**  
**FIFTH: #3 FULL SERRANO**

**Confidence Level:** 75% (Disco Time top 3), 40% (Disco Time wins)

**Key to Race:** Can White Abarrio overcome 146-day layoff with poor workout? Can Disco Time handle G1 class jump? Will outside post bias (2.23 impact) determine outcome?

**Most Likely Upset:** #10 MIKA from post #10 with elite workout - similar to Padiddle pattern at McKnight!

---

## POST-RACE ANALYSIS CHECKLIST

After results are in, analyze:

- [ ] Did predicted winner finish in top 3?
- [ ] How did workout percentiles correlate with finish?
- [ ] Did post position bias (2.23 outside) hold true?
- [ ] Did long layoffs hurt more at 9f than 12f?
- [ ] Did jockey skill matter more than at McKnight?
- [ ] Were E/P running styles favored (1.08 impact)?
- [ ] What angles did winner have that we underweighted?
- [ ] What did runner-up have that we missed?
- [ ] Calculate ROI on betting strategy
- [ ] Update calibration for route distances if needed

---

**READY FOR RESULTS!** 🏇

When race is complete, provide finishing order and we'll do comprehensive post-race analysis to refine route distance calibration.
