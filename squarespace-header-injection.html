     CLEANUP: Remove Squarespace auto-generated broken schemas.
     Squarespace injects an empty LocalBusiness (no name/address)
     and a bare duplicate WebSite (empty description).  Both fail
     Google Rich Results validation.  This script strips them
     after the DOM is built but before Google's renderer reads
     the final structured data.

        "text": "Horse race handicapping is the process of analyzing past performance data—speed figures, pace ratings, track bias, jockey and trainer statistics, and post position—to estimate each horse's probability of winning. Tools like Horse Race Ready automate this by processing BRIS past performances through algorithms that evaluate 50+ data points per horse."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Download past performances from BRIS, DRF, or Equibase (typically $3 per race card). Look at each horse's speed figures, recent form cycle, running style (early speed vs closer), class level, days since last race, and trainer/jockey win percentages. Horse Race Ready lets you paste the raw PP text and instantly generates pace projections, bias-adjusted ratings, win probabilities, and a complete betting strategy."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Speed figures (like Beyer Speed Figures or BRIS Speed Ratings) are numerical ratings that normalize a horse's finishing time based on track variant, distance, and surface. A higher number means a faster performance. They allow you to compare horses across different tracks and dates."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Track bias refers to tendencies of a specific racetrack that favor certain running styles or post positions. For example, some tracks favor early speed horses while others have deep closers winning frequently. Horse Race Ready adjusts its ratings for known biases at Santa Anita, Churchill Downs, Gulfstream Park, Keeneland, and more."
