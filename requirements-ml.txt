# Core Dependencies (existing)
streamlit>=1.28.0
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0

# ML Engine Dependencies (Phase 2)
# Option 1: PyTorch (recommended for GPU support)
torch>=2.0.0
torchvision>=0.15.0

# Option 2: Scikit-learn (CPU-only, lighter weight)
# Uncomment if you prefer sklearn over torch
# scikit-learn>=1.3.0

# Database
# sqlite3 is built into Python, no install needed

# Optional: For better performance
# numba>=0.57.0  # JIT compilation for NumPy

# Installation Instructions:
# 
# For PyTorch (recommended):
#   pip install -r requirements-ml.txt
#
# For CPU-only version (lighter):
#   pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn
#
# For M1/M2 Mac users:
#   pip install torch torchvision
#
# Note: If torch installation fails, system will automatically
# fall back to scikit-learn. Both work fine for this application.
